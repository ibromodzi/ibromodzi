### Hi there 👋 I'm Dhikrullah, aka Ibromodzi


Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about AI and Machine Learning, with a strong focus on healthcare innovation. Here's a bit about what I'm up to:

🔭 I'm currently working on multiple fun projects:

- Developing a CVF/OCT analyzer by leveraging generative AI.
- Writing theoretical papers such as quantization for effective cybersecurity analysis.
- Working on a paper that leverages large language models (LLM) for OCT image classification.
- Fine-tuning Florence-2 for medical image visual question answering.
- Collaborating with like-minded individuals to tackle malnutrition challenges in Africa using AI.



👯 I'm eager to collaborate on open-source projects that can drive innovation and make a positive impact. If you have ideas or projects in mind, let's join forces and create something amazing together!

📚 Check out my repositories for a collection of resources on Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, and more. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute.
